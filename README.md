product issues

- if someone posts to join.json from github.io and the email already exists, I want that feedback to get shows, and if the email didn't pass validation, i want that that shown
queue


- test 
- add main controller specs

todo

notes

- i really don't like the brittleness of the applied key on the student params
- the in process method is def a mess and needs to be broken up, it is inhibiting good error processing at the controller level but i don't have time to do it right now so I'm going to punt and use binary 400/200 based error handling at rubyonrialstutor.github.io cors post to /join.json

- it is a terrible dependency

- grab twitter handles on signup
- refactor pmts controller, error handling doensn't work well
- error handling for incompletely passed in params POST /join.json
